## Our Philosopy

**Inspired Education Trust (IET)** aims to develop and promote frameworks for educating children by the Prophetic Tradition of treating a child with respect for its original state of innocence (_fitrah_) and modern discoveries by scientists who promote child's intrinsic motivation to grow and learn. 

The core method we use is the _Montessori_ approach which suggests creating an environment that offers each child the opportunity to express and develop their individuality to learn at their own pace. This is based on the natural laws of human development (_fitrah_) confirmed by scientific discoveries and aligned with the Prophetic model of education.

IET's philosopy is based on the followings core priciples of education.

* Developing **good character** is the paramount aim of child education.
* Maintaining the **good guardianship** is the primary role of the teachers and educators.
* Providing **honour**, **freedom** of choice and nurturing **intellect** in children are the basic values of child education.
* **Ease and moderation** is the key method to practice in educating children
* Creating **competency, self-reiliance and committment** are the inherent goals of education.
